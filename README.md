# TuulAI RobotBuilder: Zero to Hero in AI driven Robots

This zero-to-hero robotics course follows the [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) philosophy from Jeremy Howard, where we aim to create a state-of-the-art robotic system in the first lesson itself, then dive deep into the components over subsequent lessons.

## Course Structure

The course will be built over the coming months. It will likely consist of 5 modules with a total of 10 sessions (1-3 sessions per module). Each module will include videos, scripts, notebooks, and Colab resources.
The course is WIP and the structure is subject to change.

The course will use [lerobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/tree/main) from HuggingFace as the middleware and SO100/SO101 as practical robots to build on lessons and experiment. However, you can apply these same lessons to any robot and embodiments.

### Module 1: Introduction to Robotics
- **Lesson 1:** Introduction and training an agentic robotic arm as your assistant
  - Notebook, Script, and Video
- **Lesson 2:** ACT and PI0

### Module 2: Foundational Models
- **Lesson 3:** Foundational models: Covering PI0 series, GROOT N1, Gemini Robotics
  - Notebook: [Flow Matching Pi0](https://github.com/tuulai/robotbuilder/blob/main/notebooks/pi0%20flow%20matching.ipynb), Script, and Video: [Pi0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UHMTNA4aMY), [GROOT N1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKVf7avhJxU), Gemini Robotics

### Module 3: Synthetic Data
- **Lesson 4:** Synthetic data and simulations

### Module 4: Reinforcement Learning

### Module 5: Agentic Robots with Contextual Awareness

## Who Is This Course For?

This course is designed for:
1. AI engineers or indie hackers who want to get started with robotics
2. Technical managers curious about physical AI and the oncoming robotics revolution
3. Developers of models, APIs, and tools exploring how to expand their current infrastructure for robotics use cases
